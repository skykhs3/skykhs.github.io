>UX/UI (user experience/user interface) is an important factor for a product. Someone may decide to buy or discard a product because of its design. This book describes the fundamental rules of design that designers generally know from experience. The book allows readers to learn about what constitutes efficient design and the business value of design.

## 1. Jakob's Law
 Designs should include familiar elements and functions. People prefer familiar designs and forms. If a design feels unfamiliar, they are less likely to use the product.

The difficulty of clicking something is proportional to the distance and inversely proportional to the width. In other words, touch interfaces should be close enough and large enough.

The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. Minimize and optimize the number of options. Too many options can overwhelm the user.

## 5. Postel's Law
Design for the broadest possible acceptance of variable user input.

> An example of a bad interface is one that only shows an error message after the user has finished entering their password and clicked a button to submit it, indicating that the password doesn't meet the requirements. Instead, it could provide real-time feedback below the text input field about the password's validity.

## 6. Peak-End Rule
People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.
